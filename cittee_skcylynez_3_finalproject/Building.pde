//Dao, David
class Building {
  //Fields:
  //NOTE: This will depend on how we want to define these buildings:
  //PVector position; PVector size; <- an origin and then width and height
  //OR
  PVector[] buildCells; //<- Lists all grid spaces occupied
  //^note we may change this to an arrayList
  //Dao: I am personally leaning towards the latter (buildCells).

  //Constructor
  //TODO: add args
